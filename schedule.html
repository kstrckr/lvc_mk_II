        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="red-type">Dana or “generosity”</span> is explained in greater detail below. Briefly, the giving of dana is both a cultivation of generosity in a broad sense and in a specific sense, a financial gift from student to teacher. The PayPal button below will allow you to set an amount you wish to give to the teacher of our virtual meetings on Monday nights. We are setting this option up now because of our needs to social distance and suspend for the time being our regular Monday night meditations while at the same time wanting to support our teachers.

          <h3 class="red-type">What is <i>dana</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Following the ancient Buddhist tradition of dana, students freely give to the teacher of their own generosity. There is no right or wrong amount. Just follow your heart. This tradition is of vital importance as, for over 2,500 years, it has kept the teachings open to all, and free from being reduced to a commodity for sale.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Dana is one of the most fundamental of Buddhist practices. It is a purifying and transformative practice that allows us to develop spiritually through contributing to the well-being of others. While dana can refer to how students support teachers financially, it also refers to the cultivation of generosity in all aspects of our lives. It can include generosity with our time, our energy, and through our practice when we live according to the precepts. Through dana, we recognize and affirm our connection to all beings.
