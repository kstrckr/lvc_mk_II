      sectionParagraphs: [
        'LVC does request a registration fee for retreats so that we can cover the cost of the facility. However, this does not include any remuneration for the teacher. Following the ancient Buddhist tradition of dana, students freely give to the teacher of their own generosity. There is no right or wrong amount. Just follow your heart. This tradition is of vital importance as, for over 2,500 years, it has kept the teachings open to all, and free from being reduced to a commodity for sale.',
        'Dana, or generosity, is one of the most fundamental of Buddhist practices. It is a purifying and transformative practice that allows us to develop spiritually through contributing to the well-being of others. While dana can refer to how students support teachers financially, it also refers to the cultivation of generosity in all aspects of our lives. It can include generosity with our time, our energy, and through our practice when we live according to the precepts. Through dana, we recognize and affirm our connection to all beings.'
