            <p>
                    <span class="red-type"><b>Insight meditation, or Vipassana,</b></span> is a 2,500 year old Buddhist awareness practice that cultivates clarity, equanimity, compassion, wisdom, and the possibility of living each moment fully with genuine freedom and peace. The core of insight meditation is the practice of mindfulness, the quality of awareness that sees without judgment. Sitting and walking meditation, the first steps in formal practice, become the foundation for meeting all aspects of life with a greater openness and willingness to learn. As we grow in the practice, it becomes possible to use the challenges of daily life to increase our capacity for mindful living. Our groupâ€™s purpose is to offer a supportive setting and community for this practice that is nondogmatic and nonsectarian. No particular religious belief is required.
